understanding Compressed-sensing

  * for sampling :
    - if the sampling matrix like: diag(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1)
    it can be treated as normal equal interval sampling in the time sapce
    - if the sampling matrix like: diag(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1) where the dimention is not equal to the signal length it can be treated as non-equal interval sample in the time sapce
